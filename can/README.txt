This part is about canvas. We wil try to create some javascript object with animations and put it into canvas element.

1) Load animal object (krtek.js). //HINT You should call function "canvasUpdate()" after html document is ready.
2) Start animation after click on animal. //Try to find some onclick method in "krtek.js"
3) Change position of element in canvas to right position.
